NAME="perl-Module-Build-Tiny"
VERSION=0.039
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Perl"
SUMMARY="A tiny replacement for Perl's Module::Build"
DESCRIPTION="Many Perl distributions use a Build.PL file instead of a
Makefile.PL file to drive distribution configuration, build, test and
installation. Traditionally, Build.PL uses Module::Build as the underlying
build system. This module provides a simple, lightweight, drop-in
replacement."
